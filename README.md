# Engram Configs

This repository includes Pete's revxlp config, forked and atapted for the engram & engrammer layout. 

Also includes a (mostly) matching kmonad .kbd file for parity on a MacBook keyboard, and a plist for starting on launch (copy the plist to `/Library/LaunchDaemons` and change the `/Users/you` to your username). If you use the launchdaemon plist, you'll need to add kmonad to Settings > Privacy & Security > Input Monitoring each time you update kmonad.
